These are some notes for the install script:

* Version control
When a new version of the dotfiles is installed the file .dotfiles-$USER should have a date appended to the end.

* Choices
 The script should allow for a choice of editor, browser, email client, IRC client and so on ... simply have it print to the yaourt $application and allow the user to press enter or change it, no spaghetti required.*

* Allow for expandability
set up version control such that if anything is added to the dotfiles it will be added to the git (when commited), with all the links preserved. (wildcarding stow i guess).
