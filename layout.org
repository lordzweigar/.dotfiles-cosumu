* Design
These dotfiles are a for of Neeasade's BSPWM dotfiles, However I decided to organize them into something that makes sense to me
** File layout
 All files are to be organized into one of the follwing:
NOTE: some of these catagories are mutually inclusive
* .dotfiles-$USER (autoset in script to allow for easy forking)
** window-manager
*** bspwm
bspwmrc
*** compton
- comptonrc
*** bar
- panel
- panel_bar
- info.sh
*** sxhkd
- sxhkdrc
*** dunst
- dunstrc
** terminal-applications
*** Weechat
- all the weechat stuff
*** Termite
-- termite.config  and stuff but not themes
** media
*** mpd
*** ncmpcpp
*** mpv
** editors
*** emacs
*** neovim
** static config
## this folder is 'master files' and where they will be symlinked from, for example, your bashrc, ncmpcpp config, muttrc and so on.
** themes
## This folder is for all themeing, being done this way allows for partial configs, so that your muttrc, ncmpcpp config and all of that stuff can change for every theme.
## A unified naming scheme would be a good idea. maybe <app>.config
*** theme name
  - theme-master ## this file links everything together
  - termite config 
  - bspwmrc
  - sxhkdrc
  - comptonrc
  - ncmpcpp config
  - muttrc
  - bash.conf
